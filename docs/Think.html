        <div class="text"><p>The significant challenge for me is to learn the operation and syntax in the two different environment. On Github, I can use html and css, which is very easy to modify the header and footer of my website and resize my medias. In contrast, when I build my website on Penn State's Wordpress, I find it is easier to layout my paragraph, because I can directly type my paragraph and choose the layout or format by clicking the button, rather than code different kinds of tags. It means I do not need to learn html, css, or any other language. Also, this website can check my spelling. However, I cannot resize my media on Penn State's Wordpress, and when I try to change the text color of links and the header, the effect is always unsatisfactory. On this website, I learn how to edit my resume.</p>
