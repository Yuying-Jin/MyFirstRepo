        <div class="text"><p>This is my about page.</p>
        <p>I am studying in computer science in Penn State Behrend. Also, I am interested in digital 
            art very much, especially in making videos. In ART 168, I have tried many different
            kinds of digital media, and I found they were difficult but amazing.  I often spent too
            much time in one project and met many silly problems. Still, solving problems and
            completing an artwork brought me the sense of achievement.</p>
        <p>In 2017, when I watched good promotional videos, I felt excited, so I began to learn how
            to make a video with Adobe After Effects. After one year, I started to make
            promotional videos for songs, and they were published by others online. I also makes some short videos for practice.</p>
            <p>Now I still work with others to make works together.</p>
