        <div class="text">I compared 19c-fiction fic_1873_505.txt and Jane Austen's jane_eyre_cleaned.txt.
            When the min is 3, the most frequent words in fic_1873_505.txt is "one of the", while those in jane-eyre-cleaned.txt is "i could not". It seems that the former tends to introduce sth., while the latter tends to self-expression.
            When I open the Concordance view, I can find words regarding to race after the keywords "one of the" in fic_1873_505.txt. "i could not " often be found in one person's speech.

        <div class="text">I am interested in "i could not" in Jane Eyre, so I search "i could not" and "i could" in the 19th-century fiction.
        </div>
        <img src="i_could_see.PNG" alt="i could see"/>

        <div class="text">I find that "i could" in Jane Eyre sometimes is related to what the speaker learns, and the speaker says "i could see", which means "i could learn". However,in the 19th-century fiction, the context of "i could see" is only about what the author finds via eyes.</div>
